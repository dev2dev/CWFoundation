 * @abstract A convinience category on NSObject to work with associated objects.
 *
 * @discussion Associated objects do not require an instance variable, and are
 *             released when the object is deallocated.
 *			   Associated objects can be used to add new functionality that
 *             requires internal state in categories, for example adding a
 *             property.
 *
 *			   Associated objects where added to the Objective-C tun-time in
 *             Mac OS X 10.6 and iPhone OS 3.1 respectively. This category will
 *             use the new run-time feature if available, and fall back to a
 *             slower legacy compatible implementation when run on an older OS.
 *             The legacy implementation is fully compatible to association 
 *             policies (assign, copy, or retain) to avoid retention cycles.
 *             The legacy implementation is always atomic.
