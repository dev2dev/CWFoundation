/*!
 * @abstract CWOrderedDictionary is a subclass of NSMutableDictionary providing
 *           stable ordering for keys.
 *
 * @discussion Keys are ordered with the last inserted key/value pair ordered last.
 *             Key order for ordered initializers are retained. Keys initialized from
 *             an unordered NSDictionary are undefined but stable.
 *
 *             All methods inheritet from NSMutableDictinary and NSDictionary
 *             worls as expected, except that any method providing access to 
 *             keys and values do so in with stable ordering. Eg. allKeys,
 *             allValue and fast enumeration always return objects in the same
 *             predictable order.
